# Hi there, I am Aditya Gupta
🎯 I’m currently working on  
Building full-stack projects like an employee expense tracker, turf booking app, and a utility-based NFT platform for digital assets.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on  
Web development, AI-based tools, and real-world software solutions that solve business or social problems.

🌱 I’m currently learning  
Cloud computing with AWS, microservices using Docker & Kubernetes, and the fundamentals of Blockchain development.

💬 Ask me about  
Creating practical final-year project ideas or turning raw concepts into working web applications.

⚡ Fun fact  
Besides tech, I love exploring stock markets and writing thoughts & dreams.
